# The Little Prince and the Pauper

The little prince slipped out of the palace gates wearing plain linen, his crown tucked under his arm. In the market, laughter and firelight drew him to a boy crouched by a cracked pot, coaxing music from a reed flute. The pauper’s melody held no jewels, no golden frame—just hunger, hope, and defiance against the night.

“You play beautifully,” the prince said.
The pauper glanced up, wary. “Beautiful doesn’t buy bread.”
“Then I shall pay you,” the prince declared, offering his crown.
The pauper’s eyes widened. “Why give me that?”
“Because tonight, I’d rather be a boy with music than a prince with silence.”

The pauper lifted the crown, heavy and gleaming, then set it gently on the ground. “And I’d rather be a pauper with a friend than a king without one.”

So they shared the fire, the flute, and the night—two boys trading what they did not need for what they most desired.
