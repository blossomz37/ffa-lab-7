# The Little Prince and the Pauper

The little prince slipped through the herb-girl's gate wearing undyed homespun, his silver circlet tucked into a fold of cloth. In the market, laughter and spice-laden air drew him to a boy crouched by a brazier's dying glow, coaxing music from a shepherd's reed flute. The pauper's melody held no jewels, no golden frame—just hollow-cheeked hunger, callused hope, and defiance against the night.

"You play beautifully," the prince said.
The pauper glanced up, wary. "Beautiful doesn't buy bread."
"Then I shall pay you," the prince declared, offering his circlet.
The pauper's eyes widened. "Why give me that?"
"Because tonight, I'd rather be a boy with music than a prince with silence."

The pauper lifted the circlet—heavy and gleaming—and for a breath, his fingers tightened around it. Then he set it gently on the ground. "And I'd rather be a pauper with a friend than a king without one," he said, his words coming slow, as if he still expected the treasure to vanish—or worse, to be snatched back.

So they shared the fire, the flute, and the night—two boys trading what they did not need for what they most desired.
