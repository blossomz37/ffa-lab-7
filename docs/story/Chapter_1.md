# CHAPTER 1

"Tell me about the worst comment you've ever gotten online." My voice is steady behind the camera, but Maya flinches as if I've suggested she walk into traffic.

We're sitting in her bedroom, surrounded by the digital art prints she's created but never posted publicly—vibrant, surreal portraits that swirl with color and emotion. The afternoon sun filters through her blinds, casting bars of light across her face as she restlessly shifts on the edge of her bed, fingers picking at the worn quilt.

"You sure you want to use this?" Maya tugs at a loose thread on her sleeve. "I could talk about something else. Like the algorithm stuff we researched."

I keep the camera steady, focused on her hands. "The algorithm works because it pushes things that get the strongest reactions. I need to show what those reactions do to real people."

Maya takes a deep breath, and I zoom out slightly to capture her whole face. This is the heart of my documentary—the raw nerve I'm trying to find. Not the technical jargon about content moderation or engagement metrics, but the human cost of a system designed to amplify the loudest voices.

"Someone told me I should kill myself because my art was a waste of internet space." She delivers the line in a voice scraped clean of emotion, as if reading a weather report. "It was on that digital painting I showed you—the one of the girl dissolving into birds? I spent weeks on it."

Through the viewfinder, I watch her eyes flicker down, then back up, a familiar tightening in my own chest as I recognize this visual expression of shame. My finger hovers over the record button, wondering if I should stop, if this is too much. But Maya keeps talking.

"The worst part wasn't even the comment. It was how fast it got likes. Twenty-seven people agreed before I deleted everything." She attempts a smile that fractures at the edges, never quite reaching the hollows of her eyes. "So that's twenty-eight people who think the world would be better without my art in it."

I lower the camera slightly. "Those twenty-eight people are wrong."

It's the documentarian's cardinal sin—inserting myself into the footage—but Maya is my best friend before she's my subject. Some boundaries matter more than perfect footage.

Her smile shifts into something more genuine. "Thanks, Case." 

I angle the camera back up, refocusing. "Did you ever post art again after that?"

"No." Maya tugs at her sleeve again. "I mean, what's the point? The stuff that gets attention is either perfect or perfectly awful. There's no room for just... trying things."

This is exactly what my documentary needs—this delicate, brutal honesty about who gets to be heard and who gets silenced. I zoom in on Maya's hands as she absently traces the outline of a bird on her bedspread.

"Do you think you ever will?" I ask, keeping my voice neutral despite already knowing the answer.

"Maybe someday." She looks directly at the camera now, her eyes clear. "When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

The moment stretches between us, heavy with shared understanding. I capture ten more seconds of her sitting in contemplative silence, then stop recording.

"That was perfect," I say, lowering the camera. "Seriously, Maya. That's exactly what this film needs."

She flops back on her bed with a dramatic sigh. "Glad my digital trauma is useful for your college application."

"It's not just for—"

"I'm kidding." She props herself up on her elbows. "I know what you're trying to do. And I trust you with my tragic backstory." 

I start packing up my equipment, tucking my camera into its worn case with the careful precision my mom calls "camera OCD." Maya watches me, head tilted.

"You know what's weird?" she says. "I talk to you on camera more honestly than I talk to anyone in real life."

"Maybe because the camera makes it not real life," I suggest, zipping the bag closed. "Like you're talking to a future version of someone who might understand, not the people who are judging you right now."

"Deep, Morales." Maya throws a small pillow at me, breaking the seriousness. "So when do I get to see the rough cut?"

"Soon. I need to finish the interview with Jordan Seo first. And if Ms. Santos approves my budget request, I might be able to get a few shots of the Solas campus."

"The forbidden temple of tech gods." Maya wiggles her fingers mysteriously. "Your mom could sneak you in."

"And risk her job? No thanks." My mom has worked in food service at the Solas tech campus for three years. One breach of security protocol and she'd be replaced faster than a trending hashtag fades.

I stand, slinging my camera bag over my shoulder. "I should go. Got to log this footage before my brain forgets all my brilliant ideas."

"You mean before you start second-guessing everything and convincing yourself it's all terrible?"

"That's an essential part of my creative process."

Maya snorts. "Text me later?"

"Always." 

I pause at her bedroom door, looking back. Maya has already picked up her tablet and stylus, returning to the digital art she creates but never shares. The thought pinches something in my chest—all that talent, all those vibrant visions, hidden away because twenty-eight strangers decided her voice wasn't worth hearing.

This is why my documentary matters. This is what I need to show.

---

The News Lab at North Point High is a glorious chaos in a confined space. Desks cluttered with outdated equipment, walls plastered with journalism awards from the pre-social media era, and Ms. Santos's collection of newspaper front pages documenting everything from Watergate to the Arab Spring. It smells like old coffee and printer toner, a comforting blend, and it's the only place at school where I feel completely at home, the low hum of ancient computers a steady heartbeat.

"Casey! Perfect timing." Ms. Santos waves me over to her desk where she's hunched over her laptop. "Come look at this."

I weave through the obstacle course of backpacks and camera tripods. Two sophomore staff writers are arguing about headline phrasing for next week's paper, and a junior is editing video for the school's YouTube channel. Nobody looks up when I pass. In here, everyone is too focused on their own projects to worry about social hierarchy.

Ms. Santos points at her screen. "This just crossed my feed. Content warning for rage-inducing corporate nonsense."

It's a press release from InstaFrame announcing new "creator monetization tools." I scan the PR-speak quickly, my stomach sinking with each paragraph.

"So they're restricting paid content to creators with at least fifty thousand followers?" I translate.

"And a 'consistent engagement pattern,'" Ms. Santos adds, making air quotes. "Whatever that means."

"It means they only want to pay people who already have a platform." I drop into the chair next to her desk. "The whole system is rigged for people who are already winning."

Ms. Santos nods, her dark curls bouncing slightly. "Sounds like a perfect addition to your documentary."

Ms. Santos is the only teacher at North Point who treats my documentary as more than a hobby or college application padding. She gets what I'm trying to do—expose the invisible barriers that determine whose stories get amplified and whose get buried.

"How's it coming along?" she asks, closing the press release. "Still on track for the spring showcase?"

"If I can finish all my interviews." I pull out my notebook, flipping to my production schedule. "I got great stuff from Maya today. Raw, honest. Exactly what I needed."

"She trusts you," Ms. Santos says. "That matters more than fancy equipment or perfect lighting."

"Speaking of equipment..." I give her my most hopeful look. "Any word on that budget request for external mics?"

She laughs. "Still working on it. The athletic department got a new digital scoreboard, but apparently boom mics are a luxury we can't afford."

"Priorities," I mutter.

"Speaking of priorities," Ms. Santos lowers her voice, "Avery Liang is going to be here in about five minutes for her independent study check-in. If you want to avoid the Avery Show, now's your chance to escape."

My mood deflates at the mention of Avery's name. "Thanks for the warning."

"I know she's not your favorite person, but she is going to be in here twice a week this semester. Might be worth finding a way to coexist peacefully."

I make a noncommittal noise. Avery Liang is everything I'm critiquing in my documentary—a perfectly curated online presence, monetized and optimized for maximum engagement. As North Point's resident influencer, with her 200,000 followers across platforms, she's turned being watched into a career.

"What's her independent study even about?" I ask, packing up my notes. "The economics of hawking diet tea to teenage girls?"

Ms. Santos gives me a disapproving look. "Digital marketing and media literacy. And regardless of what you think about her content, she's smart and driven."

"Smart enough to know exactly what she's selling," I mutter.

The door to the News Lab swings open, and the collective hum of focused activity falters, then dies. Conversations pause, heads turn. A wave of conscious awareness washes through the room. Avery Liang has arrived.

She glides in wearing what looks like a casual outfit but is undoubtedly tagged and sponsored in her posts—slightly oversized sweater in a perfect shade of sage green, light-wash jeans, white sneakers that somehow have no scuff marks. Her dark hair falls in waves that seem simultaneously effortless and precision-engineered. 

"Ms. Santos!" Avery's voice carries the practiced enthusiasm of someone who knows they're always being watched. "I brought you a coffee. Oat milk latte, right?"

Ms. Santos accepts the cup with a smile. "Thank you, Avery. Very thoughtful."

Avery notices me and her smile shifts almost imperceptibly. "Casey! I didn't know you hung out in here."

There's a subtle emphasis on "hung out" that suggests what I do isn't serious work. I force a smile. "Just reviewing some footage."

"For your documentary?" Her interest seems genuine, which is somehow more irritating. "That's so cool. What's it about again?"

"Digital inequality." I keep my answer brief, wary of saying too much. "How algorithms and platform design determine which voices get amplified."

"Fascinating." Avery sets her designer tote bag on a desk. "You should consider making a TikTok series about it. Short-form content gets way more engagement than traditional documentaries. I could give you some tips on hashtag strategy."

The irony is so thick I could film it. "I'll keep that in mind."

"Avery, let's go over your project outline," Ms. Santos intervenes, sensing my discomfort. "Casey, are you heading out?"

"Yeah, I need to upload this footage." I shoulder my bag, eager to escape. "See you tomorrow, Ms. Santos."

Avery waves as I leave. "Good luck with your project!"

Her well-wishes feel like sandpaper against my skin. There's nothing malicious in her tone, but something about Avery has always set my teeth on edge. Maybe it's the way her entire existence seems designed for consumption, every gesture calculated for maximum likability.

Or maybe it's just that she makes it look so easy—being seen, being heard, being validated—while people like Maya hide their light away, wounded by the very platforms that catapult people like Avery to micro-fame.

---

The cafeteria at North Point is a living map of social territory. The circular tables near the windows belong to athletes and their orbiting admirers. The long tables against the back wall are for the theater kids and band members. The corner nook is reserved for the serious academic types and early-admission college hopefuls.

Maya and I sit at our usual spot—a small table partially hidden by a support column, offering a perfect vantage point to observe without being observed.

"Anything worth documenting today?" Maya asks, picking at her salad.

I scan the cafeteria through an invisible viewfinder, my gaze sweeping from table to table, mentally adjusting aperture and focus. "Same hierarchical rituals as always. Though there's an interesting dynamic happening at Avery's table."

Maya follows my gaze to where Avery sits holding court with her usual entourage. They're all looking at phones, showing each other screens, laughing at intervals that seem choreographed.

"What am I missing?" Maya asks.

"Watch how they take turns talking. It's like they're performing a conversation rather than having one."

Maya squints. "That's... actually kind of sad."

"It's not even a real conversation," I say, unwrapping my sandwich. "They're just rehearsing for their posts, like it's a performance."

As if on cue, Avery stands up, positioning herself at a specific angle to the window light. One of her friends raises a phone, and Avery laughs on command—head tilted back, hand gracefully touching her collarbone. The sound is bright, hollow, perfectly pitched for a microphone. Three quick shots, then they huddle to review.

"That laugh wasn't even in response to anything," I observe. "Pure performance."

"You're doing your documentary narrator voice again," Maya says, smirking.

"Sorry." I bite into my sandwich, the bread suddenly dry in my mouth. "Can't help it. How was bio?"

"Boring. Mr. Chen spent twenty minutes explaining cellular respiration with sports metaphors." She pulls out her tablet. "But I did make this while he was talking."

She shows me a sketch—a stylized portrait of a girl whose face is partially obscured by a cascade of symbols: likes, shares, comments. Only her eyes are fully visible, looking directly at the viewer.

"Maya, this is incredible." I take the tablet for a closer look. "The composition, the symbolism—it's perfect."

She shrugs, but I catch the small smile my praise brings. "Just a doodle."

"This should be in a gallery, not hidden on your tablet." I hand it back to her. "Seriously. You should post this."

Her smile fades. "You know I don't do that anymore."

"I know, but—"

"Look, not everyone wants to broadcast their thoughts to the world. Some of us prefer to exist without an audience score."

I recognize the defensive edge in her voice and back off. "You're right. Sorry."

Maya sighs. "No, I'm sorry. I just... the thought of putting anything out there makes my stomach hurt."

Before I can respond, a ripple of activity sweeps through the cafeteria. Phones ding in sequence like digital dominoes falling. Maya's phone buzzes, and she glances at it.

"Avery just dropped a new post," she reports. "Something about sustainable fashion choices."

I roll my eyes. "Let me guess—linking to products she gets a commission on?"

"Probably." Maya scrolls through the post. "Though she does mention that fast fashion thing you were researching for your doc."

My head snaps up. "What?"

"Yeah, about how those cheap clothes end up in landfills in developing countries. She's advocating for 'conscious consumption' or whatever."

A cold feeling slides down my spine. I had compiled that research last week for the segment on environmental impact in marginalized communities. How did Avery suddenly develop an interest in the exact same topic?

"Can I see?" I reach for Maya's phone.

The post shows Avery in her perfect sage sweater, looking soulfully at the camera. The caption is a passionate plea about the "hidden costs of fast fashion" with statistics that sound eerily familiar.

"That's weird," I mutter.

"What?" 

"Nothing." I hand the phone back, not wanting to sound paranoid. "Just surprised Avery cares about something beyond engagement metrics."

Across the cafeteria, Avery's table erupts in celebration. Someone shows her a phone screen, and she claps her hands in excitement. Even from here, I can read her body language: victory, validation, success.

I try to shake off my unease. It's not like I have a monopoly on caring about environmental issues. Still, the timing feels strange.

The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. Maya stands, gathering her things. "You coming to history?"

"Yeah." I pack up slowly, my eyes still on Avery's table. "Hey, did I ever tell you what my documentary is actually called?"

"Something pretentious and film-school bait?" Maya teases.

"Close. It's called 'The Signal.'" I shoulder my bag. "It's about finding your true voice through all the noise."

Maya considers this, then nods. "I like it. Mysterious but meaningful."

"That's me. Mysterious but meaningful."

She snorts. "You're about as mysterious as a glass house, Case. You literally document everything you think and feel."

"Not everything," I say, thinking of the things even my camera doesn't see—my fear that no one will care about my film, my worry that I'm wasting time on a project that will never matter.

Maya bumps my shoulder as we walk. "Your documentary is going to be amazing. People need to hear what you have to say."

"What we all have to say," I correct her. "That's the whole point."

As we leave the cafeteria, I glance back one last time. Avery is still at her table, alone now, staring intently at her phone. For a brief moment, with no audience watching, her face is blank, almost empty—a canvas waiting for the next performance.

Then she looks up, catches me watching, and instantly smiles. I turn away quickly, but not before seeing something calculated in her eyes, something that makes me hold my camera bag a little closer.

---

Later that evening, I sit cross-legged on my bed, reviewing the footage from Maya's interview. My small bedroom doubles as an editing suite, with my ancient laptop balanced on a stack of books and external hard drives clustered on my desk like electronic mushrooms.

Through my headphones, Maya's voice plays back: "Maybe someday. When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

I pause, making a note on my storyboard. This line perfectly captures the central question of my documentary: Who gets to decide what matters? Why are some voices amplified while others are silenced? How does the system itself—the algorithms, the platform design, the engagement metrics—shape whose stories are seen and valued?

A knock at my door interrupts my thoughts. My mom pokes her head in, still wearing her work uniform from the Solas campus cafeteria. Her hair is pulled back in a tight bun, and the faint lines around her eyes look deeper than they did this morning.

"Dinner in fifteen," she says. "Just reheating leftovers."

"Thanks, Mom." I pull off my headphones. "How was work?"

She shrugs, leaning against the doorframe. "The usual. Fed a bunch of tech geniuses who don't know I exist." Her eyes land on my laptop screen. "How's the movie coming?"

"Documentary," I correct automatically. "It's good. I got some great footage from Maya today."

My mom nods, but I can see the question in her eyes—the same one she's been asking in different ways since I started this project: What's the point?

"This is really important to you, isn't it?" she says finally.

"Yeah, it is." I close my laptop, giving her my full attention. "It's about something that matters."

"I know, honey." Her smile is tired but genuine. "I just worry about you putting so much time into something that—" She stops herself.

"That what?" I prompt.

"That might not have the outcome you're hoping for." She says it gently, but the words still sting. "I just don't want you to be disappointed."

What she means is: I don't want you to waste your time. What she means is: There are safer paths to focus on. What she means is: People like us don't get to change the world.

"I'm not expecting it to change everything," I say, trying to keep the defensiveness out of my voice. "But it might change something. For someone."

She studies me for a moment, then nods. "Okay. Fifteen minutes for dinner."

After she leaves, I reopen my laptop and stare at the frozen image of Maya. Her expression is open, vulnerable, honest—everything my documentary needs to be.

My mom doesn't understand that this isn't just about college applications or building a portfolio. It's about proving that stories like ours deserve to be told. That voices like Maya's matter. That the system that silences them needs to be exposed and challenged.

I press play again, and Maya continues: "When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

"Your voice already matters," I whisper to the screen. "And I'm going to make sure people hear it."

A warm certainty spreads through me—the feeling that despite my mom's concerns, despite the massive forces working against stories like mine, this documentary could actually make a difference. It's a delicate, hopeful feeling, as fragile as it is powerful.

I save my work and close my laptop, holding onto that hope as I head to dinner. Tomorrow I'll keep filming, keep documenting, keep fighting to amplify the signals that get lost in the noise.
